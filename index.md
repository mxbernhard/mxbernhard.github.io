Hi! I'm a journalist and researcher focused on **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** techniques and digital investigations. 

I currently work as a journalist for [CORRECTIV](https://www.correctiv.org/en) where I cover disinformation.  

Previously, I worked as a freelancer and as a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/max-bernhard). 

I’ve reported on far-right and fringe groups, dis- and misinformation, as well as environmental and human-rights issues in the UK, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong and Japan. My work has been published in **The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, Wired UK, Vice, the BBC** and more.  

I also [teach](https://dataharvest.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OSINT-Tool-Box-Part-2.pdf) other journalists how they can use OSINT in their reporting and [consult](https://www.saferworldforthetruth.com/investigations/sardasht-osman) human-rights organisations how they can apply these methods in their work.
