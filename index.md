I'm a freelance journalist and researcher focused on `open-source intelligence (OSINT)` reporting and online investigations. 

Previously, I was a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/max-bernhard). 

I’ve reported on far-right and fringe groups, dis- and misinformation, as well as environmental and human rights issues from the UK, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong and Japan. My work has been featured in publications such as `The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, Wired UK, Vice, WSJ and the BBC`.  

I also [teach](https://dataharvest.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OSINT-Tool-Box-Part-2.pdf) other journalists how they can use OSINT in their reporting and [consult](https://www.saferworldforthetruth.com/investigations/sardasht-osman) human-rights organisations how to use these methods in their investigations.
